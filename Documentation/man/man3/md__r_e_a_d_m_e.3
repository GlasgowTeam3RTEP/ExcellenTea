.SH "Description"
.PP
.PP
Excellentea is an automatic tea maker\&. The user can operate the machine remotely through an online interface\&. In other words, you can order your tea, by chosing from several modes, as you leave work and find it ready when you get home\&. It also comes with the option of controlling the machine using control buttons and an LCD display\&.

.SH "Usage"
.PP
.PP
.SS "Installation"
.PP
Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi and run the following commands:
.PP
.PP
.nf
\&./configure
make
make install
.fi
.PP
 The program can then be started by running the command
.PP
.PP
.nf
excellentea
.fi
.PP
 from the terminal\&.

.SS "Additional components"
.PP
The project also requires standard passive components (e\&.g\&. resistors), prototyping tools (e\&.g\&. breadboard/pcb) and materials for the encasing\&. See the \fCcircuit schematics\fP for details\&.
.PP
.SS "Protocol"
.PP
The digital temperature sensor DS18B20 communicates with the board through a 1-wire protocol on pin 7 (BCM4)\&. The reed float sensor only outputs two-states so a communication protocol is not required\&.
.PP
.SS "Prerequisites"
.PP
The raspberry PI must be connected to the internet for remote access\&.
