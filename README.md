# Description

Excellentea is an automatic tea maker. The user can operate the machine remotely through an online interface. 
In other words, you can order your tea, by chosing from several modes, as you leave work and find it ready when you get home. 
It also comes with the option of  controlling the machine using control buttons and an LCD display.

1. Load your cup with water

2. Load your tea infuser with the tea of your choice
---

For remote control: 

3. Activate the tea maker from the online user interface

4. Choose the brewing mode of your tea

5. Wait...tea is ready:)


# Hardware

## Key components

- 1 Raspberry PI microcontroller board (tested on version 3 Model B)
- 1 Stepper motor (MIKROE-1530)
- 1 Digital temperature sensor (ds18b20)
- 12V DC power supply 
- 1 heating element (12V) (B004O8BGXE)
- 1 tea infuser 
- 1 reed float sensor (59630)
- 2 18-pin through hole socket (ED18DT)
- 2 Bipolar transistor array (ULN2803A)
- LCD
- 2 N-channel logic-level MOSFET (FQP30N06L)
- MOSFET heat sink (507222B00000G)

## Additional components
The project also requires standard passive components (e.g. resistors), prototyping tools (e.g. breadboard/pcb) and materials for the encasing. See the [circuit schematics](Main.sch) for details. 

## Protocol

The digital temperature sensor DS18B20 communicates with the board through a 1-wire protocol wired on pin 7 (BCM4). The reed float sensor only outputs two-states so a communication protocol is not required. 

## Prerequisites

The raspberry PI must be connected to the internet for remote access.
